NAME
    Markdent - An event-based Markdown parser toolkit

VERSION
    version 0.23

SYNOPSIS
        use Markdent::Simple::Document;

        my $parser = Markdent::Simple::Document->new();
        my $html   = $parser->markdown_to_html(
            title    => 'My Document',
            markdown => $markdown,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a toolkit for parsing Markdown (and Markdown
    variants, aka dialects). Unlike the other Markdown Perl tools, this
    module can be used for more than just generating HTML. The core parser
    generates events (like XML's SAX), making it easy to analyze a Markdown
    document in any number of ways.

    If you're only interested in converting Markdown to HTML, you can use
    the Markdent::Simple::Document class to do this, although you can just
    as well use better battle-tested tools like Text::Markdown.

    See Markdent::Manual for more details on how Markdent works and how you
    can use it.

ALPHA WARNING
    This code is still quite new. While the Markdown to HTML conversion
    seems to work fine, the internals are subject to change.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-markdent@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org>. I will be notified, and then you'll automatically
    be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
    consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free
    time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care
    to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
    this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
