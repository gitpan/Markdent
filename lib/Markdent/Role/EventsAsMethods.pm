=head1 NAME

Markdent::Role::DebugPrinter - Turns events into method calls

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role takes a L<Markdent::Event> object and turns it into a method call.

=head1 METHODS

This role provides the following methods:

=head2 $object->handle_event($event)

This takes a L<Markdent::Event> object and turns it into a method call on the
object.

The method name is the same as the value of C<< $event->event_name() >>. The
hash reference returned by C<< $event->attributes() >> is turned into a set of
named parameters for the method. However, any keys starting with "!" in the
attributes will not be passed to the method.

So, for example, a L<Markdown::Event::StartLink> event turns into a method
call like this:

  $handler->start_link(
      uri            => $event->uri(),
      title          => $title,                     # optional
      id             => $id,                        # optional
      is_implicit_id => $event->is_implicit_id(),
  );

=head1 ROLES

This class does the L<Markdent::Role::Handler> role.
